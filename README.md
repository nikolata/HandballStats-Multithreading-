# HandballStats-Multithreading

Producer-Consumer multithreading handball stats project

run ```python3 main.py``` to start the project

It will wait for your input (we assume that threre is no wrong input)

Example input: ```Bulgaria | Italy | 3:0 | 2:2```

The program will run until you write ```stop``` or you enter 50 inputs

I'm open for feedbacks!

Thank you for your time!
